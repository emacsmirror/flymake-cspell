* flymake-cspell.el

A Flymake backend for [[https://cspell.org/][CSpell -- A Spell Checker for Code!]] by [[https://streetsidesoftware.com][Street
Side Software]]. :heart:

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =flymake-cspell.el=, put it in
your =load-path= and =require= it.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package flymake-cspell
  :ensure)
#+end_src

To enable CSpell for a major mode, add =flymake-cspell-setup= to that
mode's hook:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'flymake-cspell-setup)
#+end_src

Or, alternatively, with =use-package=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package python
  :ensure nil
  :hook (python-mode . flymake-cspell-setup))
#+end_src

* Customization Options

The =cspell= process is executed in the =default-directory= of the checked
buffer, so will pick up the nearest cspell configuration file. CSpell
offers a bunch of customization options (custom words per project,
excluding files from spell checks, etc.) -- best see the [[https://cspell.org/configuration/][related section]]
in the official docs for details.
